# isomut_analysis
Usual R notebook for routine analysis of Isomut output files

The application of this notebook is mainly the usual expremiental workflow that our group uses ie. analysis of 20+ more or less isogenic cell clones that differ in their genotypes or some expremiental setting (keeping condition, drug etc).
